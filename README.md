## Overview

asyncio is a library to write **concurrent** code using the **async/await** syntax.

asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level **structured** network code.
